# ImagesToPdf [[Deprecated](#deprecation)]
Combines images into a single PDF. ðŸ˜‡

### Deprecation
This package relies entirely on the wonderful [HummusJS](https://github.com/galkahana/HummusJS) PDF library, which unfortunately but understandably is [no longer being maintained](https://github.com/galkahana/HummusJS#hummusjs). Hummus now **`fails as of Node v14`**, so that limitation is present in this library as well. I have no plans to rewrite this package to use a different PDF library, but I'll happily entertain contributions and discussions to that end.

# Quick Start
### Install
```sh
npm install --save images-to-pdf
```

### Use
```js
const imagesToPdf = require("images-to-pdf")
await imagesToPdf(["path/to/image1.jpg", "path/to/image2.png"], "path/to/combined.pdf")
// path/to/combined.pdf now exists.
```
